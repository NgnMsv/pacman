# pacman
This project implements a Pacman agent using the Minimax algorithm, demonstrating adversarial search techniques within a multi-agent environment. The agent is designed to navigate the game, make strategic decisions, and optimize its gameplay based on various factors such as proximity to food, distance from ghosts, ghost states, and overall game score.
